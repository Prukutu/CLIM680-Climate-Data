   * type in the Zoom chat window
* I will attempt to monitor each of these and acknowledge people in the order in which they requested to speak.
* This class will be recorded in Zoom. Videos will be posted on the course Blackboard site.  Videos may also be used in other GMU courses or video snippets that do not identify students may be used in public forum (e.g. website, twitter, etc.) as an example or advertisement of online course instruction. If you have privacy concerns, please speak to me ASAP.
* Please be patient with technical issues as we all learn how best to do online learning via Zoom and do the best we can with our personal home internet.  Your feedback however is also welcome and encouraged.  See Feedback section below.

### Best ways to contact me

1. _MS Teams_: This is the most efficient way to contact me and receive a reply. During normal work hours, I will likely respond to you within an hour or two if I am at my computer.
2. _Email_: I typically respond to emails within 24hrs during the work week and on Mon morning for emails that arrive over the weekend.  If you have not heard a response by this time, then I may not have received your email, so please re-send.
3. _Office Hours_: Please email me if you wish to meet individually and we will schedule a time to meet in Zoom.

### Class Attendance

This is a synchronous, online course which means that it meets regularly online at a specified day and time. It is in your best interest to attend class during the scheduled class time.

_Live Coding_: One of the reasons you should attend class in person is that this class will utilize a methodology called “Live Coding”.  This means you will follow along with me while I share and write code on the screen and explain the code as I go.  There will be no powerpoint presentations. This method is shown to be effective because it slows down the pace so everyone can keep up, forces me to take the time to explain what I am doing, helps you get accustomed to running codes yourself on your computer setup, and lets you see me make mistakes and how to correct them.

#### _If you miss class_

I understand, however that there can be various reasons for missing class and that connectivity issues do occur.  If you miss class for whatever reason, all the information will be available to you on the course Blackboard site and Collaborative Document, including:
* Link to class materials
* Link to video of class
* Link to Collaborative Document
* Assignments posted in the Collaborative Document

### Continuity Plans

Given the current times, there are constant changes and new University guidance regarding University operations.  There is also the possibility that a student, instructor, or family member that they care for may become ill and alternate arragements will need to be made.

We will follow all University guidance.  Typically I learn official University guidance at the same time as you.  I will promptly follow up with you via email and MS Teams about how the latest guidance impacts this class.

In the event that you as a student are unable to continue with the course, please notify me immediately so that we can discuss your options.  In the event that I as the Instructor am unable to continue teaching this course, it will continue as planned at the same day/time with a backup instructor.

### How will you be graded?

This course requires students to apply the analysis techniques learned in class on sample datasets to a dataset used in their own research. Your grade will consiste of 50% _homework assignments_ and 50% your _final project_ and calculated as follows:

* Homework Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 50% (25% Github repository and website; 25% presentation)

#### _Assignments_
Assignments are given most weeks and require you to add something to the previous week’s analysis of your dataset.  It is in your best interest to complete these assignments on time in order to keep up with the class.  Assignments will be given in class and indicated in the Collaborative document. Four(4) of the assignments will be formally graded.  You will provide me with a Github link in the Collaborative Document to turn in your assignment. Instructions will be provided in class.

Assignments will be graded as satisfactory (A), not satisfactory (C), or not/minimally attempted (F) promptly after the due date. Feedback will be provided via Blackboard or Github Issues.

If the assignment is graded not satisfactory or not attempted, you may redo the assignment until it is satisfactory until the last day of class (Dec 3). You must notify me if you wish me to re-grade a re-submitted assignment.

#### _Final Project_
In addition to the four graded assignments, You are also expected to complete a project with website in Github and give a presentation in class of your project. Project details will be provided in class and posted on Blackboard.

#### _Exams_
This class has no exams.

### University Policies

#### _Academic integrity_

 It is expected that students adhere to the George Mason University Honor Code as it relates to integrity regarding coursework and grades.  The Honor Code reads as follows: To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the University Community have set forth this: Student members of the George Mason University community pledge __not__ to cheat, plagiarize, steal and/or lie in matters related to academic work. More information about the Honor Code, including definitions of cheating, lying, and plagiarism, can be found at the Office of Academic Integrity website at (http://oai.gmu.edu).  __In this class, working together is strongly encouraged and doing so is not a violation of the Honor Code.  Each student must complete their own model runs, their own analysis codes and figures, and their own writeup of the assignment.__

#### _Disability accomodations_
<a href="http://dsgmu.wpengine.com/">Disability Services</a> at George Mason University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students by upholding the laws that ensure equal treatment of people with disabilities.

#### _Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, and Interpersonal Violence_

As a faculty member and designated _Responsible Employee_, I am required to report all disclosures of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason’s Title IX Coordinator per university policy 1412.

You may also seek assistance from Mason’s Title IX Coordinator (703-993-8730; titleix@gmu.edu).

#### _Diversity and Inclusion_

Diversity and inclusion mean much more than _do not harrass_.  They mean creating an environment where diverse viewpoints and perpsectives are welcome and everyone feels they are part of the team.  This class aims to be an intentionally inclusive community that promotes and maintains an equitable and just work and learning environment. We welcome and value individuals and their differences including race, economic status, gender expression and identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, first language, religion, age, and disability.

<p><a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/non-discrimination-policy/">Mason Non-Discrimination Policy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://stearnscenter.gmu.edu/knowledge-center/general-teaching-resources/mason-diversity-statement/">Mason Diversity Statement</a></p>

The following kinds of behaviors are encouraged to foster an inclusive environment:
<ul>
<li>Use welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focus on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</li>
<li>Be Kind</li>
</ul>

#### _Netiquitte_

An important component of inclusivity is to be aware of how our communication impacts others. Electronic communications require additional care to avoid misinterpretation. The following behaviors are encouraged for online communications:

* Avoid vague words, jargons, and sarcasm.
* Limit or eliminate the use of exclamation points, bolding, capital letters, and emoticons.
* Change subject lines of email chains regularly.
* Plan carefully who to CC on messages.
* Edit meticulously.

#### _Religious Holidays_

It your responsibility to notify me within the first two weeks of the semester of any religious holidays in which you will be absent or unavailable due to religious observances.

#### _Privacy_

Student privacy is governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and is an essential aspect of any course.
Students must use their MasonLive email account to receive important University information, including communications related to this class. I will not respond to messages sent from or send messages to a non-Mason email address. As a reminder this class will be recorded.

### Feedback

When teaching online, it can be more difficult for me to gauge student understanding than in person.  In person, I can usually see on a student’s face whether they understand something or not.  This is much more difficult in an online environment.  Additionally, I am consistently working to make my online courses as engaging and effective as possible.  Feedback will be regularly requested at the end of each class period and provide information to adapt the course throughout the semester for this specific class. Additionally, a post course survey will provided to get your overall feedback on the course separate from standard course evaluations which do not provide sufficient useful information for improving the course.  Please help to develop this course by providing feedback so that the course can improve and adapt.
