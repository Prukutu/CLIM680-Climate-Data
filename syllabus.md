## Meeting Days/Times
Thurs @ 10:30-13:10 by Zoom [ Registered students will receive a Zoom invitation ]
The class period is divided into two parts: 10:30 to 11:40 and Noon to 1:10.  Each part will start promptly.

## Best ways to contact me
1. __Email__: I typically respond to emails within 24hrs during the work week and on Mon morning for emails that arrive over the weekend.  If you have not heard a response by this time, then I may not have received your email, so please re-send.
2. __MS Teams__: I have created a Microsoft Teams Channel for this class which you will be invited to.  This will give students an opportunity to interact with me and with each other outside of class. Please discuss assignments, class materials, ask questions, or share resources using this channel. Use it to help each other.  I will also monitor notifications and respond to questions regularly.
3. __Office Hours__: Please email me if you wish to meet individually and we will schedule a time to meet in Zoom. 

## Pre-requisites
* Computer programming course or experience in any language
* MATH 115 or an equivalent course

## Overview
How to process, analyze, and interpret environmental data for climate and related disciplines. Familiarizes students with software commonly used in atmospheric research and with techniques for working with large quantities of data. Examines mathematical tools for characterizing global physical data sets which vary in time and space, and applies the tools to observations and numerical model output.

__At the end of this course,learners will be able to:
* Work comfortably from the Unix command line
* Read a variety of climate data formats and make maps of the data
* Handle large simulation and re-forecast datasets
* Perform basic set of statistical analyses on climate datasets, including:
   * climatologies and anomalies
   * monthly and seasonal means and variances
   * correlation and autocorrelation,
   * regressions between a climate index and global fields
   * composites
   * climate patterns calculated via EOFs
* Calculate statistical significance (i.e. t-test, f-test) and graph maps with a mask/stippling.
* Write codes in Python and use Jupyter notebooks 
* Utilize good programming practices
* Debug, problem solve, and simplify problems
* Make publication/public quality plots
* Develop and maintain their own Github repository of climate data analysis tools and codes from this course
